# Snippetbox
Snippetbox is a web application designed to store and manage user-submitted code snippets. It leverages Go's templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering and utilizes MySQL for data storage. 

At the moment, the server can only handle HTTPS requests using self-signed certificates.

## ‚ú® Usage
### Pre-requisites
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) (or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/where-to-download-mariadb/))
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Running the app
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:edbar42/snippetbox.git
```

Go to the directory where you cloned the app in and install its Go dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```
Run the `make tls` script to generate self-signed TLS certificates for the HTTPS server:

```bash
make tls
```

> [!WARNING]
> Since these certificates are self-signed, your browser will (probably) give you a warning when trying to access the website.

Finally, you can use `make run` to start the application:

```bash
make run
```

Your server should now be running on [`https://localhost/42069`](https://localhost:42069/) (nice).

If you would like to delete the files generated by `make`, simply run `make clean`.

```bash
make clean
```

### Testing
To run the **full** test suite shipped with the app, run `make test`.

```
make test
```
